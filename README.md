CAD models and 3D printed a casing to protect a Raspbery Pi 5 intended to be on the end effector of the robotic arm for the Robots for Space Exploration rover. Done as design team work for Robots for Space Exploration.

**Highlights**
- **Acheived User Friendly Design:** Simple lid intuitive to access and remove the rapsberry pi.
- **Wiring Friendly:** All ports and wire connections have openings, even on the lid. Allows for no hinderance to use whilst protecting fragile components.
- **To be 3D printed:** Allows for protptyping and reiteration.
