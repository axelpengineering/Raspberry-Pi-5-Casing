# Raspberry-Pi-5-Casing
CAD models and 3D printed a casing to protect a Raspbery Pi 5 intended to be on the end effector of the robotic arm for the Robots for Space Exploration rover. Done as design team work for Robots for Space Exploration. Defined the dimensions of the motor control unit, which is significant as it will be included in the science module in the final rover.

**Highlights**
- **Acheived User Friendly Design:** Simple lid intuitive to access and remove the rapsberry pi.
- **Wiring Friendly:** All ports and wire connections have openings, even on the lid. Allows for no hinderance to use whilst protecting fragile components.
- **To be 3D printed:** Allows for protptyping and reiteration.

## Results
**Project Results**
- TBD

**Personal Outcomes**
- Learned the importance of dimension tolerances for different kinds of fits for 3D printing.
- Learned about designing for 3D printing, easy assembly, implementation, minimizing volume taken, compatibility with other rover components and flexibility.
- Practiced the engineering method of iteration and rapid prototyping.
- Designed with robtics/mechatronics components in mind, considering the design itself focused on something that controlled actuators. This links to the hardware aspect of robotics.
